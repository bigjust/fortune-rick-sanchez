T-t-t-this is just sloppy craftsmanship.
%
Oh, yes, Morty. It's almost unbelievable, isn't it?
%
Oh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing.
%
Oh! Responsive, too! In real time! I love it!
%
Oh, what's with Mom? So, you're saying that she's acting weird? How soph—*burp*—isticated. Careful, guys. You're gonna burn out the CPU with this one.
%
Whatever, quote-unquote “Morty.”
%
*spying from outside* Interesting…
%
*kicks open the door* Morty, u-uh, come on. There's a family emergency.
%
He doesn't care.
%
Take a shower with me, Morty.
%
Listen to me, Morty. Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now. *strips* Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty.
%
Morty, that's not class. T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher. This isn't your school. This entire world is not the world. We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.
%
It’s all fake *burps* Morty, all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of… crazy, fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn't say so until we got in the shower. They won't monitor us in here.
%
Zigerion scammers, Morty. The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity.
%
I can’t let you do that, Morty.
%
No! You give it to me!
%
Morty, come on! Morty!
%
Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs.
%
Well, look at that old lady. She's, she's walking a cat on a leash.
%
Look, I-I-I don't wanna hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! Alright, alright, there. W-what about that, Morty?
%
Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before?
%
You're missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No.
%
Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention.
%
Yeah, it's a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this. Now they're gonna pay!
%
We'll scam the scammers, Morty. And we're gonna take them for everything they've got.
%
Morty, relax. It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there. You're gonna be fine. (Lowers Morty’s pants slightly and puts a hat on him.) Just follow my lead. (Rick and Morty fist bump.) Yo, deejay, drop that beat.
%
Uh-oh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts. I don't think we can perform our new song, "The Recipe for Concentrated Dark Matter," for a crowd this tiny.
%
Now that’s more like it! Morty, here we go. Let me hear everybody say "hey-oh!" yeah! (Crowd cheers.) All the ladies say, "yeah!" (Ladies cheer.) Everybody over thirty, do this with your hands! Everybody with a red shirt, jump up and down! (People start glitching.)
%
Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an "L" who isn't Hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times ten! (Simulation freezes. Rick and Morty jump offstage.) Run, Morty! Before the system reboots!
%
Out of the simulation, Morty. Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to…the edge. Here we go. *jumps off the edge*
%
Come on, Morty.
%
Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty. That's how we're gonna scam these idiots.
%
It's an obsession for them at this point. The Zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty. Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them. *finds central processing room* Aha! Here we go. *starts collecting chips* Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty. These guys aren't good at much, but they're really good at making these chips.
%
Don't worry about it, Morty. There's plenty of them, you little goofball. (Both laugh and toss chips at each other playfully.) Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!
%
Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella.
%
Totes malotes, dawg.
%
Believe it, Morty. And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry, and the Zigerions got nothing of mine.
%
Get in, Morty. I'm gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff. (Keypad beeps.) Huh. I thought I entered the code right. (Keypad beeps.)
%
Uhh…
%
Uh, yeah, until I get home before you and change the combination, you bunch of idiots!
%
RUN MORTY!
%
Jerry?!
%
What are you doing here? W-why are you dressed like a waiter? Screw it. We don't have time. Come on. *starts dragging Jerry with them*
%
Man up, Jerry! I may need you to work the lasers.
%
I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter.
%
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, Plutonic quarks, and bottled water.
%
Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts Plutonic quarks, one part cesium.
%
Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no time!
%
Oh, no.
%
No!
%
You simulated my grandson's genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!
%
All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now?
%
Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it. So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity?
%
Maybe you're right, Jerry. Maybe you're right.
%
Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh, yeah. You can't. They blew up.
%
Hey, Morty.
%
Hey, little buddy. H-h-how you doing in here right now?
%
Y-y-you're a good kid, Morty. Y-you're a real l-little c-character, Morty.
%
You know, I had a really rocky road today, M-Morty. You're my little friend, aren't you? We had some good times together, huh, M-Morty? We You're a real true hero out in the field. You're a... You're a real trouper, huh, M-M-Morty?
%
I really appreciate you, Morty.
%
*suddenly aggressive, holds a knife to Morty’s throat* You little son of a bitch! Y-y- are you a simulation?! Huh?! Are you a simulation?!
%
You little son of a bitch!
%
I-I-I’m sorry, Morty. Y-you're a good… You're a good kid, Morty.
%
Y-you're a good… You're a good kid.
