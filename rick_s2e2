Learning to fly this thing, Morty, it's gonna be really liberating. Y-Y-You’re gonna be free to go on all kinds of errands for me.
%
*points out the window* See that planet right there? Don’t fly too close to that planet. Someone’ll come out and try to wash your windshield. (Rick’s phone rings.) Hold on. *picks up* Yup. Yeah, I have it. Where do you wanna meet? Alright, cool. *hangs up* Alright Morty, lesson’s over. We got some business to attend to a few lightminutes south of here.
%
*startled* WHOA! Jesus, Jerry, what the hell are you doing here?!
%
I guess I remember that. *rubs forehead* Wow. And you’ve just been back there this whole time? Amazing. Well we don’t have time to take him to Earth, Morty. Head for 3124-917.
%
Yep.
%
Nope. (An asteroid-like mass materializes before them.) This is. You can park in a handicapped spot, Morty. Anything with less than eight limbs is considered disabled here.
%
You kidding? I wish I had this idea. Well… I did have this idea, but I wish I was the version of me that owned it. That guy’s rich.
%
*checks off “Stowaway” and “Annoying me”* Trust me Morty, I’ve heard stories from other Ricks. Jerrys don’t tend to last five minutes off of Earth. This is a totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid. Here they can romp and play with other Jerrys. It couldn’t be safer.
%
Hey Morty, hang onto this. That number’s your dad. If you lose it, we’re not gonna be able to get him back.
%
Okay, wait here.
%
Don’t come with. It’s boring, it’s *burps* business stuff.
%
Right, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? Y-You know what those guys do in th—in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls, and they dip ‘em in cocaine, and they wipe ‘em all over each other. You know, Grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public because Grandpa isn’t shady.
%
Ah, crap. *rolls down window* Hey, what’s up?
%
Can… Can we please…? This is my grandson, Morty.
%
Ugh. *passes Krombopulos Michael a case containing the antimatter gun* Here, now go away.
%
Y-Y-Y-You’re gonna give him your card?!
%
Ugh… You’ve got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset, Morty. It’s more complicated out here! These are Flurbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish with three thousand of these?
%
An entire afternoon at Blips and Chiiiitz!
%
Aw, this place is the best. It’s got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is.
%
Yeah, sure, if you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty. *puts a helmet on Morty’s head* Here, check this out.
%
Fifty-five years. Not bad, Morty. You kinda wasted your thirties though with that whole birdwatching phase.
%
Morty. You were just playing a game. It’s called Roy. Snap out of it, come on. *hands him his tickets*
%
Lookit this. You beat cancer and then you went back to work at the carpet store? Boo.
%
It’s also the same as doing nothing. If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there’s not a lot anybody can do to stop him. That’s why he does it for a living? Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s time to thrash your Roy score. *puts on the helmet*
%
Uh-huh, yeah, that’s the difference between you and me, Morty. I never go back to the carpet store.
%
What are you doing Morty?! This is a Galactic Federation outpost! Look, I don’t have time to tell you my entire backstory, but Grandpa and government don’t get along!
%
What?
%
Oh, good job, Morty. Y-Y-Y-You killed my best customer but you saved a mind-reading fart!
%
Morty, don’t do it. (Morty walks toward the lever.) Morty… (Morty glances at Rick before pulling the lever. Alarms start to sound as Fart escapes his cell.) Morty, you idiot!
%
We can’t get him outta here. He’s gaseous. He’s not gonna make it through a portal, Morty.
%
Morty, come on, I-I wanna go back to Blips and Chitz. I don’t wanna deal with this!
%
Screw this. I’m out.
%
Stupid-ass fart-saving carpet-store motherfucker! *shoves Morty out of the driver’s seat and takes the wheel* Move!
%
Wait, did you fuck with my seat settings?
%
Yeah, yeah. (He crashes the car into the Gromflomites before flying away from the outpost.)
%
That’s ‘cause my grandson drives like a male Obavradian. Yeah, I said it. Some stereotypes are based in fact.
%
*interrupts him* So I’ve heard. Just fix it. *to Morty* I don’t think the Gromflomites can track us now, but it looks like we’re gonna be here for awhile. *lowers voice* Or, ya know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped, we can finish the job and go home.
%
I’m being polite.
%
Yeah, where’s that? Are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it?
%
Oh great, just a hop, skip, and an 800 lightyear jump!
%
*walks away, muttering* Whatever you wanna do you little punk-ass little bitch…
%
*holding a golf club* Shut the fuck up about moonmen! This isn’t a musical number. This is a fucking operation, we gotta be cool and fucking lay low!
%
Son of a… *approaches Fart* Why were the Gromflomites holding you prisoner? What the fuck is so valuable about you?
%
*picks up the gold* Ah, terrific. The fart that pooped gold. No wonder every cop in the system is lookin’ for us! *pockets gold* Any species that gets a hold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy. Do you know how inconvenient that’s gonna be to my work?
%
Somebody dropped the dime on us. Gearhead… *turns around*
%
Number One is me, asshole! You’re supposed to be my friend!
%
Two things I wanna make clear to everybody in this room. Never betray me, and it’s time to go.
%
Hey Morty, remember when you said selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger? How do you feel about all these people getting killed because of your choices?
%
Tell that to Gearhead’s gearsticles.
%
Wrong! I’d be playin’ Roy right now. At a certain point, my hands are tied, Morty.
%
Morty, take the wheel!
%
Whoa!
%
Geez, dammit, Morty! Who taught you to fly this thing?! *laughs* Haha, I’m kidding, I know that’s on me.
%
Shit. Well, I guess this is it.
%
Damn. Can’t blame that on the dog. …Talk about silent but deadly. I-I’ve seen some nerve gas but ga- th-this gas got some nerve! Haha, you know what I’m sayin’?
%
I’ll let you know, Morty. Gone with the wind, am I right? If you don’t like that one, Morty, an alt on that one could be, like…if I said Gasablanca! …Alright, I’m done. (Morty starts driving.) Let’s get to the Promethean Nebula, so my grandson can finish savin’ a life!
%
Fine. Morty, take your fart to his hole and say your goodbyes. I’m gonna find some fuel and take a biiiig fat Morty. (Morty gets out of the car.) That’s my new word for ‘shit’ because of today’s events.
%
So did you guys make out a little bit? Is he gonna send you a postcard? (Morty wordlessly enters the car.) Man, that guy hit the lottery when he crossed paths with you.
%
Morty, I know I picked on your core beliefs and decision making a lot today, but I am glad you insisted on gettin’ that fart home. You know, at least all the death and destruction wasn’t for nothin’, you know? *notices Morty’s detached, almost anguished expression* You miss your fart friend, huh? Well I’ve got a little surprise for you, buddy. While you were gone I found another wormhole with millions of beings just like him on the other side and they’re all coming to visit.
%
Too late, Morty. The hole’s opening.
%
Th-there’s a lot more where that came from too.
%
Hey. *taps another Rick’s arm* Hey bro. How many people was your Roy responsible for killing today?
%
*glares at Morty* Must be nice… Hey, Morty, there’s our Jerry.
%
Glad you’re safe Jerry. What do you say we go home?
%
Uh, I’m not sure. Morty.
%
Way to go, Morty. Eh, whatever.
%
Alright, come on, Jerry.
%
It’s the coolest place in the world! Hahahaha, I g- I get to be in a commercial!
