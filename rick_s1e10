        Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
%
It is.
%
Oh, there's no need to do that, Beth. Regular pancakes are fine.
%
Oh, I get it. Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers. [takes bite] Mmm, I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me.
%
Rick Sanchez of Earth dimension C-137. You are under arrest for crimes against alternate Ricks by the authority of the transdimensional council of Ricks.
%
Neutralise the Jerry.
%
Everybody relax. If I know these a-holes, and I am these a-holes, they just wanna haul me to their stupid clubhouse and waste my time with a bunch of questions. Let’s get it over with.
%
Bring his mo-[belches]-orty.
%
Leave my [belches] Morty out of this!
%
You lost the right to have a say in these things when you refused to join [belches] the council.
%
Will you at least unfreeze my daughter’s idiot?
%
The citadel of Ricks. It’s the secret headquarters for the council of Ricks.
%
wh-wherever you find people with heads up their asses someone wants a piece of your grandpa. And a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem. So a few thousand versions of me had the INGENIOUS IDEA OF BANDING TOGETHER like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those people who answer questions on yahoo answers.
%
Geez, you’re easy to impress. Yeah, most timelines have a Rick and most Ricks have a Morty. This place is a real who’s-who of who’s you and me.
%
Turn your boring old Morty into a hot fashion statement, with some Morty dazzlers!
%
Hey, check this out!
%
Dumb.
%
‘Scuse me, sir, is your Morty insured? You know, every year hundreds of Mortys are injured in-
%
Back off! Not my cup of tea, this place.
%
I say the point of being a Rick is being a Rick.
%
Save your anti-Rick speech for the council of Ricks, terror-Rick!
%
Hey, save your Rick rules for the [belches] sheep-Ricks, Rick-pig!
%
Fuck me, pal.
%
Fuck you? No no no no no, fuck me!
%
Bring up the holograms!
%
Twenty-seven Ricks brutally murdered in their own timelines. An unprecedented Rick-icidal epidemic. What say you, Earth Rick C-137?
%
You think I did this? Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe?
%
You [belches] have a history of non-cooperation with the council.
%
Yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as Rick! Wh-wh-wh-why isn’t he here in handcuffs?
%
Because he’s dead too!
%
No!
%
Who else would you have us question? You fit the profile. Of all the Ricks in the central finite curve, you’re the malcontent. The rogue.
%
I’m the Rick. And so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance. You wanted to be safe from the government so you became a stupid government. That makes every Rick here less Rick than me.
%
(Can you believe this guy? This guy needs to get out of here, etc. Ad lib)
%
Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them. They’re about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste. And I hate to get all Andy Rooney about it, but I think we all like fluffy discs of cake with syrup on top! And I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there’s evidence! So as they say in Canada, peace oot!
%
Evidence? Good idea. Scan his portal gun!
%
Oh, come on. Don’t look at another man’s portal gun history. We-we all go to weird places.
%
Yes, but it appears you alone have been going to the exact timelines and locations in which the murders occured!
%
What? That’s Rick-diculous. I’m obviously being set up!
%
Earth Rick C-137! The council of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom, which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds, rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you know becomes impossible to grasp. Also every ten seconds it stabs your balls.
%
I’ve heard enough.
%
Run, Morty!
%
That’ll keep ‘em [belches] busy for a while.
%
‘Course not, Morty! How could that profit me? Someone out there is killing Ricks, and the council ain’t gonna stop thinking it’s me until we clear our names.
%
By finding the real Rick killer.
%
Not really my style, Morty. Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks right now.
%
Alright, listen, Jerry. If Rick calls, this device is going to trace his location. You just gotta keep ‘em on the phone for thirty seconds or longer.
%
Oh yeah! Mmm! Oh, delicious!
%
Beth, [belches] you’re a treasure.
%
I have a Beth just like you in my [belches] reality, except you know what? She’s not as brilliant or [belches] attractive!
%
Hey Jerry, it’s Rick.
%
So listen, the heat’s on and [belches] there’s nowhere left to turn so Morty and I are just going to fly my spaceship into a black hole.
%
Is that cool with you, dog?
%
I got it! The call’s coming from… inside the house!
%
The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry. They won’t be able to help themselves. But as soon as they get bored they’ll be on to us.
%
Yeah, more phonesticks please.
%
Yeah, it’s gotta be that way. You’re a camouflage.
%
Ricks have a very distinct and traceable brainwave due to our genius. The best way to hide from an enemy’s radar is to stand near someone with complementary brainwaves that make ours invisible. See, wh-wh-when a Rick is with a Morty, the genius waves get cancelled out by the uh, [clears throat] Morty waves.
%
Oh, shit dog! My portal gun was hacked remotely Morty, obviously by the real killer to frame me. But I was able to trace the signal. Come on, let’s go!
%
Uh-oh!
%
‘Scuse me, we’ve tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location. They look exactly like us, so in order to avoid confusion I’m going to mark us each with a red X right now. That way if someone has a gun and we both tell you to shoot the other one because they’re the evil one, you’ll know who’s lying.
%
Hey, check it out!
%
Dammit!
%
The red X! Red X!
%
Hey, it’s a good thing that space outlet had labcoats and your favourite kind of shirt in stock, huh Morty?
%
Man, this place is wayyy off the grid. This guy does not wanna be found.
%
Morty, you’re making a bigger deal out of this than it is.
%
Not people, Morty. Mortys.
%
Well, one Morty’s enough to hide from the bureaucrats. But you g- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put ‘em in agonising pain. That creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks, motherfucker. I fiddled with a [belches] concept like this once.
%
On paper, Morty, on paper! I wouldn’t do this, it’s barbaric overkill. I mean, you could accomplish the same result with like five Mortys and a jumper cable. [pauses as Morty glares at him] Which I also wouldn’t do! I’m just saying, it’s bad craftsmanship.
%
Hey, get a load of this! Jerry’s hanging out with doofus Rick.
%
Haha, this is perfect.
%
Oh, is that the timeline where everybody eats poop? Jerry, you know this guy eats poop, right?
%
[laughing]
%
Hey, it’s your choice to take it personally, Morty. Now for the love of god, be quiet! The point of this is to get the drop on the guy!
%
Yeah, that’s right! You are! You’re a perfect impenetrable sheet of human armour, Morty! Because you’re as dumb as I am smart! Which is why when I say ‘shut up’ it’s really good advice.
%
Great, nice work, Morty.
%
Urrgh.
%
The slow clap? Really? Kinda played out, dude.
%
Well lah-dee-dah. [slow claps]
%
I don’t like the look of that Rick, Morty. We gotta escape.
%
Don’t be Rickdiculous, Morty.
%
Yeah, yeah, looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here. Zing!
%
That guy got it.
%
Hey, I’ll take it over Mumford and Sons. Zip!
%
This guy is on it!
%
Awww.
%
Yeah, duh!
%
I get it. So you want me to team up with you to take down the council of Ricks, right? Is that where you’re going with this? ‘Cause that’s where I’d be going.
%
No, I’m just allergic to dipshits.
%
Morty! Get me out of this! Come on!
%
Point taken, but this is [belches] no time for arcs.
%
Yeah, hello?
%
Hey, what do me and O.J. not have in common?
%
Huh? Wh-who is this?
%
I found the real killer, biitch! Get over here!
%
Yo ding-dong! We’re done here. Time to go.
%
Uh, guys? Not a good time. Come on, Morty, let’s hit it.
%
Alright, Morty, don’t break an arm jerking yourself off.
%
Hey Morty, you want connection? Go be part of some stupid club like all those dumb Ricks. You know, maybe I don’t connect because I’m the Rickest Rick there is. And you know, it would [belch] go without saying that the Rickest Rick… would have the Mortyest Morty.
%
Yeah, it would. Did you hear me say it?
%
Just don’t get too big for your loafers, Buster Brown. A cocky Morty could lead to some big problems. Could be a real bad thing for everybody.
%
I-I-I’ll explain when you’re older.
%
What a mess…
%
Pride cometh before the fall. I guess he got what he deserved.
%
What is that?
%
Hand me the laser defibrillator.
%
No! Go clean the toilets! Maybe you’ll make friends with some turds!
%
You make us ashamed to be ourselves!
%
My god! I’ve seen this technology before! This Rick was being controlled remotely, puppeteered by somebody else. This is the receiver!
%
Yeah, but where’s the transmitter?
%
Wubbalubbadubdub! Oh. Hey Jerry. Wh-wh-what are you doing in my room, buddy?
%
Alright. Okay, get out.
%
What’s that dipshit doing out there? Are you friends with him? You know he eats his own shit, right? Oh my god, this is rich! I’ve got like [belches] ten Ricks to call right now!
