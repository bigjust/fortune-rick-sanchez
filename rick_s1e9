Whatever.
%
Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing.
%
Pass the butter.
%
Thank you.
%
I’m busy.
%
Uh, anything else?
%
You pass butter.
%
Yeah, welcome to the club, pal.
%
Since when did you have a job?
%
Wee-ow, can’t wait to meet this fascinating character.
%
(inspecting objects) Huh.
%
Eh, I make my own stuff. So what are you, like, the devil?
%
I dunno, store comes out of nowhere, all the shit’s old and creepy; are you the devil? A demon? Leprechaun?
%
Hey, I’m not judging. I just like to shoot straight. I’m a man of science.
%
Hahahahaha.
%
Hey, Morty, lemme ask you a question real quick. Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it?
%
Rhetorical question Morty. The answer is yes, you just have to be a genius.
%
Your sister’s boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded.
%
Uh, Morty, I’m not disparaging the differently abled. I’m stating the fact that if I had used this microscope, it would have made me mentally retarded.
%
Well that’s retarded.
%
Apparently nothing.
%
It’s not.
%
Whoa.
%
Stay scientific, Jerry.
%
This serum should counteract the negative effects.
%
[giving back microscope] Here. You can have this back.
%
Sure I did. To develop this. It detects and catalogues all your Twilight Zone Ray Bradbury Friday the 13th of series voodoo crap magic. I thought you might want it so you didn’t accidentally sell anybody, say, [scans] a typewriter that generates best-selling murder mysteries, then makes the murders happen in real life? Oooh.
%
Don’t you want to make sure people know what they’re getting? You’re not intentionally selling [scans] beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty but also makes them blind?
%
Oh, I say, good sir! Oh, harrumph, oh, oh, bobba-doppa-doopa-bo-bo. [scans animal fur scarf being tried on by customer] That’s beautiful, you know it’s going to be wearing you in three hours?
%
Here, you can use my phone. Don’t worry, it won’t make you deaf because I’m not a hack.
%
Think you’re so great?
%
You work for the devil!
%
So what?
%
Whoops.
%
Have you acquired creepy, specific old stuff from an antique or thrift store that grants you powers but fucks with you in unforeseeable ways? Bring it to Curse Purge Plus! I use science to uncurse the items for cash, and you get to keep the powers! This guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster! But guess what? He would have had to run until he died, making them worthless. I removed the curse, making them worth, like, I dunno, eight million dollars? See ya at the olympics. This eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family. Now it does their taxes.
%
Don’t pay for cool stuff with your soul. Pay for it with money. You know, like how every other store in the world works? We’re located at First and Main in old town. Come on, come on down.
%
Wubba… lubba… dub dub!
%
Wubba lubba dub dub!
%
That’s right across the street from Needful Things, where you can get evil items for free!
%
Looks like we’ve got… haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion, in 1936 and then you’ll be trapped there winning the same fight for eternity. I can take out the eternity, and the padding, and then you’ll have some time travelling mittens.
%
Oh, look, it’s Rosemary’s baby! How’s business?
%
Sounds like code for ‘You win, Rick!’
%
Nope, it was important to your dumb devil friend. To me this was all just a bit like when Bugs Bunny fucks with the opera singer for twenty minutes.
%
Seriously? Holy crap. Holy crap.
%
Uh huh, yeah, I don’t care.
%
So?
%
I always do.
%
Yeah, it is good. It’s the best.
%
Later!
%
Yeah, uh, gimmie a sec.
%
Alright, yeah, uh, put ‘em on my… eh.
%
I just got bored. Everybody out.
%
[looks into Morty’s room] Hey Morty, you wanna go on a- oh. [goes into kitchen] Hey Beth? Hello? [Goes into living room] Hey Jerry, you in here being stupid? [sighs]
%
Thanks. Hey, y’know, I was thinking I might watch a movie…
%
Suit yourself.
%
Hey! [clears throat] Hey. What’s going on?
%
Whatever.
%
How’s your pretend grandpa doing AKA the devil?
%
Oof, sorry.
%
Hm, not sure.
%
No, that’s dumb.
%
I’ll tell you what though, if it’s satisfaction you’re after, I think I might have an idea. [whispers]
%
Stupid mother-
%
Stupid motherfucker!
%
How do you like that! Augh! How do you like that?
%
We did it!
%
Was totally worth it! We did it, hahaha! We just pulled it off!
%
Hahaha!
