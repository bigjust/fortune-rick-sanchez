Yeah Morty
%
It's my favourite song
%
Oh yeah, distress beacon! [belches] Yeah baby!
%
The first rule of space travel kids, is always check out distress beacons; nine out of ten times its a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit!
%
One out of ten times its a deadly trap, but I'm ready to roll those dice!
%
Yeah. Cha-ching. Oh yeah, if you find a room full of eggs, don't shy away from it, give one of them a shake. Those facehuggers are worth more than this ship.
%
This will make the cops write it up as a looting by the Korblocks.
%
I hear you man, cops are racist.
%
Oh, hey! You're alive! Thank God.
%
And how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you? Those two ding-dongs seem pretty calm about the whole thing.
%
Called it.
%
Unity!?
%
Oh boy. Uh, these are my grandkids, Summer and Morty. Summer, Morty, this is uh, Unity. We sort of used to, uh, date.
%
Quite an operation you got going here Une. You're a whole planet now huh?
%
Summer, rude. Why don't you kids run off and play with Unity while Unity and I do some catching up.
%
World peace achieved. Nice! A little weird to publish a paper about it for yourself, but hey. So what’s next?
%
Oh, goody.
%
[burps] I like that. Oh, that’s pretty sexy. Hey listen, where can I get a drink around here?
%
Unity, Unity, who am I talking to? I watched you assimilate a whole police station just to get your hands on the evidence locker.
%
Hey, listen, I’ve grown too. I have! See, I’ve- I’ve reconnected with my family, right?
%
Maybe it’s part of getting old. Maybe I just miss being with… a collective.
%
Oh yeah!
%
Wait, wait, stop! H-Hold it! Not like this. We need a hang glider. And a crotchless Uncle Sam costume. And I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked redheads! And I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father!
%
Oh yeah! I want youuuuuu!
%
Oh my god. Oh my god. [Drinks water]
%
What’s this ‘was’ stuff? I just need to hydrate and then we’re doing that again!
%
Listen, if this is an invasion I gotta sit this one out, but I’ll- I’ll be back to have sex with the survivors.
%
All bad I hope. [laughing]
%
Whoa, Jesus Christ!
%
Oh snap! Powdered neutronium? Amphetetron? You know what I can make with this stuff?
%
Come on, it’s not every day that I’m in town! It- it’s for old time’s sake.
%
Oh, I was thinking velocitinis, but…
%
I can do whatever you do and more, baby.
%
You know, I think Beta-7 over there is hoping your alliance can be more than practical.
%
You got that right. But… baby, listen. Y-you’re talking about taking over planets and galaxies, you gotta… you gotta just… remember to let go sometimes, you know.
%
Whoa!
%
Whoa! That’s not what I meant!
%
[laughing] Oh, that was awesome! My grandkids weren’t in that town, right? A-are my grandkids alive? … H-hey, my drink is empty.
%
What the hell… is your problem?
%
Fine, geez!
%
See ya!
%
Tend your garden, kids, I’m kinda doing a thing here.
%
Oh my god [belches] you guys I get it. You’re afraid the big bad hivemind is gonna steal  your grandpa away.
%
What?
%
Oh, gee, boy Summer, well put. Uh, why don’t we see what Unity thinks. Unity?
%
Oh, hey, wh-what’s this on the news, guys? L-l-let me turn it up.
%
I think you two are a little outnumbered.
%
What? Dumb. Bye.
%
Summer’s just a hyper-emotional, needy little- what’s the word I’m looking for here… uh- human! It runs in the family! I can tolerate it but I can’t give a crap about it. Take a hike.
%
I’m not looking for judgement, just a yes or no. Can you assimilate a giraffe?
%
Aaah! [coughs] Okay, okay, now make him cry. But happy cry. Now make ‘em all make fun of the blonde one. Now make ‘em all do it on the table! I can’t believe you created a whole show for me. Now cancel it! Okay, now put it back on. Haha! [pauses] Alright, I’m bored.
%
Pfft, screw those guys! Uugh, I’ll be right back. Don’t waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity. They’re no different from any other aimless chumps that you occupy. They just put you at the centre of their lives because you’re powerful and then because they put you there they want you to be less powerful. Never gonna happen though, right?
%
Never! Back in a flash.
%
Best weekend ever, Rick! I agree, Rick! Let’s see how long we can go!
%
Hey Une! You got any more-
%
Hey.
%
Okay.
%
No. It’s your house.
%
Who? Oh. Unity. Yeah, well, I mean honestly we’re talking about an entity that thrives on enslavement, you know. It’s not cool. Fun’s fun but who needs it? I’ll be in the garage.
%
Unity! Unity! Unity!
%
I wanna talk to [belches] Unity. Beta-7, I know it’s in there!
%
I know your game, Beta-7, I’ve met a billion of you, you little on-deck in-the-wind shoulder to cry on!
%
Well, you’re just loving this, mother f- this isn’t gonna shape out like you think, pal! Unity’s not into other hiveminds! It’s gonna suck you in and use you up and a month from now I’m going to be making out with all of you in a bunch of red wigs! Unity! Unity! Unity, I know you can hear me! Get out here!
%
Oh, in your dreams you have weapons systems.
%
We are, Morty. Alright, Beta-shit-7, you just got saved by the bell, bitch!
