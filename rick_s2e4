Well I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry. But life is made of little concessions.
%
Who the fuck are you?
%
Everybody just relax for a second. There's no such thing as an "Uncle Steve". That is an alien parasite.
%
No you haven't Jerry. These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories they use those to multiply, spread out, and take over planets. It's disgusting.
%
He's a real piece of shit! This is a big one, someone probably tracked in last week on the bottom of their shoe or on a piece of alien fruit.
%
Get off the high road Summer, we all got pink eye because you won't stop texting on the toilet.
%
No, "Steve" put that memory in your brain so he could live in your house, eat your food, and multiply. We could be infested with these things, so we gotta keep an eye out for any zany, wacky characters that pop up.
%
Thanks Mr. Poopybutthole. I always could count on you.
%
Alright, there's six of us and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, and Summer.
%
Can't afford to chance it.
%
Trust me Beth you don't wanna know how many answers that question has.
%
Why couldn't I bring my portal gun? (Morty winces )
%
Six, Morty! There's supposed to be six of us! If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real.
%
I guessed. That's why I aimed for his shoulder.
%
Wait.
%
No! Don't flashback!
%
Take that!
%
Everybody stop remembering! These parasites are like bed bugs, and every flashback is another mattress. Look! There's only supposed to be six people in this house.
%
No! Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down means that there's four parasites.
%
All right, there's six of us, ( belches ) and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary, Photography raptor, Mr. Beauregard, and Summer.
%
6, 10, what's the difference? I just love the number 6 for no reason! Where's my pencil at?
%
Oh, thanks, Pencilvester! (writes the number 6 again) Yeah,I-I g-- I guess that is what happened, but I-I don't get why I would do that.
%
That is su-- [belches] -- suspicious. We're always hearing about this Tinkles character, but we never get to â€“
%
Look, I'm not used to being this unsure for this long. I'm just gonna aim for shoulders starting with the weird girl. (Tries to shoot Summer)
%
Hold still, "Summer."
%
Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just think that, Sleepy Gary? I've known you for 15 years. Don't make me hurt you.
%
Wait, why would you want me to -- You're one of them, aren't you?
%
Shut up, Hamurai! Shut up, Amish Cyborg! What is this? '90s Conan?
%
You know what, Pencilvester? It took me my whole life to realize it, but I love barbecuing.
%
Watch me, baby. I'm like tom cruise from, um, "cuisine" or w-whatever that movie's called where he makes drinks. Yeah, check me out. I'm like tom cruise from "cuisine." ( chuckles ) yeah. Is that what it's called? "cuisine"?
%
Wait. (cut back to the present, breathing heavily ) Noooooo! Shoot. Now look. It's like a "Where's Waldo?" page. Can you find me? Check out all these zany characters. We'll be right back after these messages.
%
Can't do that, Sleepy Gary. All right, everybody listen to me. I don't know if any of you guys are real, but this house has been infested with fake loved ones that spread through fake memories, and our planet will be destroyed if they get out. ( grunts )
%
You guys, we got to hurry. I just got back from Walmart. They're selling Nintendo 3ds systems for $149.99 on sale, plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card. Brings the total price down to $110 after tax. Now, listen, we can flip those sons of bitches for 230 bucks apiece easy! They're all limited-edition "Zelda" ones. Hurry! Hurry! Come with me! We can be rich, and we also all get to keep one and we can play nintendo games! Nintendo, give me free stuff.
%
Okay, yes, I definitely remember doing that, but also, I would never do that
%
Uh, no thank -- ( grunts ) Okay. Trying to figure out how to lower the blast shields, huh? Anybody here think it's suspicious that a lot of people in here can't wait to get out of here?
%
So, what are you gonna do when you rotate back to the world, Frankenstein?
%
No! Get out of my head, parasite! No! Drop it. Give me the gun, Frankenstein! ( indistinct shouting ) Give it back!
%
( breathing heavily ) Is anyone here even real? Am I the only real person on earth?!
%
Hey, don't blame me! I tried to shoot Summer 10 minutes ago!
%
Wubba lubba dub dub! Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch! And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes. Hit the sack, jack. Uh-oh! Somersault jump. Aids! And that's why I always say shum shum shlippedy dop! Grassss tastes bad-ah. No jumpin' in the sewer. Burger time! Rubber baby baby bunkers! Lick, lick, lick my balls! ( laughs ) yeah! Say that all the time.
%
Beth, I'm your father!
%
Why don't you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy with an old Jewish comedy writer's name?
%
Shut up, Morty, you brainwashed, little turd that might not even be real because I'm brainwashed, too.
%
Oh, oh, oh, really? Well, I remember you as a whiny, little piece of shit, Morty!
%
Yeah! I've got about a thousand memories of your dumb, little ass and about six of them are pleasant. The rest is annoying garbage. So why don't you do us both a favor and pull the trigger? Do it! Do it, mother[bleep] Pull the [bleep] trigger!
%
What the hell?
%
Holy crap, Morty, you're right.
%
Well, yeah, duh-doy. T-took you long enough. (Rick turns the dial on the washing machine, the wall draws back to reveal a set of guns)
%
Now let's go, Morty. We got a lot of friends and family to exterminate. ( grunts )
%
We need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly. Who's got a bad memory about Mrs. Refrigerator?
%
Everybody back! If you're not a parasite, you have nothing to fear. What about Summer?
%
(Corners Pencilvester) Come on, man. Haven't we ever had an uncomfortable silence or an awkward fart on a road trip? Come on, Pencilvester. Give me anything.
%
You're right. (To Morty) Kill Pencilvester.
%
I guess I did the butler! Ha ha! Does -- d-does that scan?
%
Thanks, ghost in a jar. You always were good at pointing out potentially obscure comedy. (shoots ghost in a jar, parasite screeches ) ( screeches )
%
From now on, let's all be careful to wash our hands when we get back from outer space. That goes for everyone.
%
At least we're real, Jerry. We're real. Ricky ticky tavi!
%
No, Beth! Oh [bleep]
%
Oh, geez! Oh, my god!
%
Listen, Beth, don't torture yourself. I made a similar mistake years ago, but, you know, on a planetary scale.
%
He's not pressing charges. I mean, that's got to be the "you shot me" equivalent of not being mad.
%
(Smiles) And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes.
