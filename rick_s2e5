Oh boy. Time to go, Morty.
%
The Pentagon. I mean, not THE Pentagon. *burp* The lame one, here on Earth.
%
Morty and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight.
%
Stay back! This watch turns people into snakes!
%
My name is Rick Sanchez. This here’s my grandson Morty. (drinks from flask)
%
I’ve seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we’ve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math. (points to viewscreen showing floating head) This head won’t go away until *burp* Earth shows them it’s got a hit song.
%
No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms.
%
You’re gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.
%
Good luck, Mr. President.
%
I dabble, Mr. President.
%
Who’s NOT a musician, Morty?
%
Yeah, not with that attitude.
%
WhooooOOOOAHHHH!!!!
%
(picks up a microphone) All right, Morty, let’s get ready to do it! Why don’t you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat?
%
Morty! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Gimme a beat!
%
Ahhhhh yeahhhhh
%
Take off your pants and your panties
%
Take a shit on the floor
%
Hey, take your pants off
%
I think planet Earth has just been transported.
%
Uhh, it’s probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead.
%
Whoa ho ho ho ho!
%
Geez, Morty. The guy’s just doing his job. Take it easy.
%
Genius happens in the moment, Morty. (walks over to keyboard)
%
That’s planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning. (presses a button on the keyboard) Balls.
%
Morty, Morty, stop! Listen! There’s only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we’re not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it?
%
Yeah, *burp* you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities, *burp* Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can’t get schwifty.
%
Hey, Morty! Could you lick my… (Rick presses keys on the keyboard with the sample of him saying “Balls”)
%
Wait, wait, wait! Come on, h-hold on a second!
%
Whoa, whoa! Morty! Give me that!
%
Morty, just put it down. You don’t know what you’re doing.
%
Nooooo!
%
Ahhhh, sh**!
%
Wh-What do you think, Ice? Probably a little over-developed.
%
Well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, or… ?
%
Ice, I don’t want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but *burp* if Morty doesn’t come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it’s, uh, kind of your problem too.
%
What? Why not?
%
What the f***? You can turn into ice?
%
Take it from me, Ice. *burp* You can’t just *burp* float around space not caring about stuff forever.
%
Ahem. (starts a low-key, bouncy song) Uhhh… lop-oo-lop-oo-lop-oo-dups, nop-oo-nop-oo-nop-oo-nuts.
%
Nup-oo-nup-oo-nup-oo-nups… ooh, tough crowd.
%
Morty!
%
I say… (grabs mic) Let’s do it!
%
All right!
%
Come on, here we go!
%
Say it with me!
%
Trade secret, Mr. President. Particle beam in a wristwatch… snake holster on the leg.
